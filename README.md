# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project was completed as part of the **AI & ML Internship Task 2**, which focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis using the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.
## Objective
Understand the Titanic dataset using statistical methods and visualizations to extract insights, patterns, and relationships between features and survival rates.
##  Tools Used
- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)
##  EDA Highlights
- Summary statistics (`mean`, `median`, `std`, etc.)
- Null value detection and handling
- Distribution plots (age, fare)
- Boxplots (Age vs. Pclass)
- Correlation heatmap (numeric features)
- Count plots (e.g., Gender vs Survival)
##  Visuals
Plots were created using `seaborn` and `matplotlib` and include:
- Age distribution histogram with KDE
- Boxplot of age across passenger classes
- Heatmap showing correlations between numeric features
## Key Insights
- Younger passengers had higher survival rates
- Females had higher survival rates than males
- Passengers in 1st class had better chances of survival
- Significant missing data in `Age` and `Cabin` columns
